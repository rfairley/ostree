# IDE Configuration

Although `ostree` does not use `cmake`, you may be using an IDE like VSCode or CLion.  

In order to have the complete `Go to Definition` functionality, these IDE(s) will need the path location of `compile_commands.json`. This json file is generated by running `cmake` with this option [`-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html).

[Converting Autotools to CMake](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7132862/tutorial-for-converting-autotools-to-cmake) can be a treacherous path.

Leaving the green squiggles under the source file i.e. the `#include` preprocessor directive will not affect the autotool build, but you will not be able to jump to the definition of a function; especially if it is defined in a submodule. Specify the path manually within `ostree/.vcode/c_cpp_properties.json`.

For more information on how to specify the include paths, see [Configuring includePath for better IntelliSense results in VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/blob/master/Documentation/Getting%20started%20with%20IntelliSense%20configuration.md#configuring-includepath-for-better-intellisense-results).

Remember to _not_ `git add` the `/.vscode` directory.
